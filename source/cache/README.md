### Directory description

This directory contains *.cls "bare" files, which are Caché class definitions. The
word "bare" here means that files should not be directory imported into Caché without
the project build.

These files are exported from Atelier (Caché 2016.2+). Some of them contain special
patterns, which are processed during the build. Feel free to modify these files and
follow contributor's guide which can be found in the sources root folder.
